A collection of my old and retired projects for different things. They don't
need their own repositories cluttering up my github page anymore so I'm
consolidating them here since I don't quite want to just delete them yet.

* `butrmanager`
    * A set of daemon for managing multiple minecraft servers from a minimal
      terminal interface. I wasn't exactly happy with how intrusive and complex
      the other minecraft server management tools at the time and I just wanted
      something small and simple that I could put on any random machine and have
      up and running in a couple minutes and could just as easily remove. I built
      it so that you could kick off tasks from the cron or wherever to do things
      like generate world maps, rotate backups, clean up saves, etc. I used it
      to manage ~5 minecraft servers on a medium sized digital ocean droplet
      with all kinds of mods and custom maps for several years for around 30-40
      players.
* `chip_engine`
    * A half-baked tile based RPG game engine using pyglet with a custom json
      based file format for maps.
* `esp8266-buildbox`
    * The build scripts to setup and use a docker container for building C/C++
      projects for the ESP8266 with the vendor toolchain. I built this as I was
      trying to figure out an easy way to develop for the ESP8266 on Windows, Linux,
      and macOS in basically the same way. Was back in the early days of docker.
* `Multi_Minecraft`
    * Some very old batch and powershell scripts to let you quickly swap between
      different versions and configurations of minecraft clients on Windows. I
      built this many years before the version selector was built into the minecraft
      launcher, in fact I'm not sure there even was a launcher when I first put this
      together. It was a child of the frustration I had with copying files back and
      forth when I played on several different minecraft servers and every week a 
      new modpack was coming out and needed different versions of everything.
* `site_source`
    * HTML/CSS/JS and some markdown post content from my old personal website.
* `TextAdv1`
    * Probably my oldest github repo, it's just a small half-working text adventure
      game I was writing in python for fun years ago.
