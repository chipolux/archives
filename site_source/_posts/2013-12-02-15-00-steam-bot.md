title: Steam Bot - Shopping better, with Python!
tags: [blog, bots, reddit, steam]
---

I spend a lot of time on Steam, and almost as much money. I also spend far
too much time on Reddit, so to save myself some time and money I built a
Reddit bot that will make reports on the best stuff on sale and post them!
You can see how I did it after the jump.

Steam is just about the best place to buy games online anymore. Not
necessarily for price reasons but for the combination of good prices,
excellent community, and ease of use.

An issue I've ran into time and again is how difficult it can be to figure
out everything that's on sale and how much it's going for. So to fill this
gap I started work on what is now
[/u/steam_bot](http://www.reddit.com/user/steam_bot) on Reddit.

Basically it pulls down current store data for every app in Steam and
formats it into a nice little report every six hours. Sounds simple enough
right? Well not exactly.

##How'd Ya Do It!?

###The Toolbox
* [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org) - My Python version of choice due to working conditions.
* [Requests](http://www.python-requests.org) - Best HTTP request handling module out there!
* [PRAW](http://praw.readthedocs.org) - Best Python Reddit API Wrapper!

This is my standard toolset I use when building a new reddit bot. Keeps it
nice, simple, and light!

###Building It
***Note: For this walkthrough I'm going to take the path of least
resistance, there will be better ways of doing a lot of these things and a
lot of uncaught exceptions but I leave finding those as an exercise for
the reader.***

First we need to gather up info on all the apps in Steam, app ids and names
mostly. We can get that from the public API endpoint here:

    http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v0002

Here's the beginning of what you should see returned:

~~~
{
    "applist": {
        "apps": [
            {
                "appid": 5,
                "name": "Dedicated Server"
            },
~~~

You don't even need an API key, though I always recommend being nice to
public API's and avoiding anything that could be misconstrued as abuse.
Steam has pretty specific rules on API usage you can find [here](http://steamcommunity.com/dev).

That endpoint will give you a list of all the app ids and names that Steam
currently tracks.
*This includes servers, movies, dlc, and stuff we have to remove later.*

You can easily load up that info and parse it out into a nice list of
dicts like this:

<p><script src="http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=AC8LuhPc"></script></p>

Now that we've got all the app ids and names into a big list we can start
doing some fun stuff!

It's nice to add the store url to each of the items which we can do like so:

<p><script src="http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=7cGeA40M"></script></p>

Python never copies variables except in very specific cases or if you do it
explicitly, this lets us update all the apps in place while we iterate over
the loop without having to worry about indexes and such. Just remember never
to remove or add anything to a loop you're iterating over!

Next we can grab the price and other store page data. Unfortunately there
isn't a valid public API endpoint for this. But a little snooping of the
JavaScript on the store pages and a few trips to google turned up an
undocumented endpoint!

*Note: Undocumented endpoints can change suddenly and should only be used
with caution!*

    http://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails

This endpoint gives us basically all the worthwhile content from the store
page, including price and discount percent.

There are only a few parameters for this endpoint that I'm aware of:


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>appids</td>
      <td>List of comma separated appids to retrieve info for. Up to 10 seems to work fine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>cc</td>
      <td>Country code to retrieve other countries prices and localizations.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The response you get from this endpoint looks basically like this:

~~~
{
    "<APPID>": {
        "data": {
            "steam_appid": "<APPID>",
            "price_overview": {
                "currency": "USD",
                "initial": 5999,
                "final": 5999,
                "discount_percent": 0
            }
~~~

And so on, there are a ton of fields with all kinds of neat data you can
explore, for now we're only concerned with the price overview and a few
other bits.

So we can go about loading the information for each app like this:

<p><script src="http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=hsFEB04L"></script></p>

That's the simplest way to get the data, but I recommend building a list of
apps around 5 long and requesting all at once to drastically lower your
request count as well as other optimizations to filter out non-game items.

Now I also wanted to get a bit of information about current players to help
decide what the best apps really are. Fortunately Steam has another handy
*documented* endpoint for us:

    http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserStats/GetNumberOfCurrentPlayers/v0001

This endpoint requires a parameter, `appid` which is the integer appid like
we got from the first request. Here's some sample output:

~~~
{
    "response": {
        "result": 1,
        "player_count": 205
    }
}
~~~

We'll use requests again to get the current players for all the apps:

<p><script src="http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=niP7rM2P"></script></p>

So now we have a big list of all the apps on Steam as well as their store
page information and how many players are currently online for each. It's
all just a mish mash right now so let's start filtering out the cream of
the crop!

Python has some really nice simple dataset manipulation tools out of the
box, first lets remove all apps that aren't on sale using the builtin
[filter](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#filter) and a
quick [lambda](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#lambda)
expression. We can also quickly sort by current players and pull out the
top 20 using the [sorted](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sorted)
function:

<p><script src="http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=BQnKMmbA"></script></p>

Now we can start formatting a Reddit post! Reddit self posts need a title
and a string of body text that can be up to 10,000 characters long. We'll
start with the title:

<p><script src="http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=7TchPnmk"></script></p>

That will give you a nice little post title with the date and UTC time in.

Next we can build the post body, I basically use a bunch of tables, reddit
uses a nice set of Markdown syntax, you can find a reference
[here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting).

<p><script src="http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=sA8bTrAq"></script></p>

You can see how I used Python's implicit line continuation within
parenthesis to keep the code clean and under the usual 80 character limit
as well as using some of the more complex string operations to format the
price and discount numbers on line 7.

Now all we need to do is initialize a reddit instance using praw and get a
subreddit instance to submit to.

<p><script src="http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=EH5h8GWC"></script></p>

All four of those lines have the potential to raise exceptions but I'll
leave catching and handling them to you.

Now that we have our subreddit context to post to, our post title and body
to submit there's only one thing left to do!

<p><script src="http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=q7qVT5RD"></script></p>

`result` will contain things like your post id, url, etc. If it's unable to
post it will raise an exception.

And that's it, you've made a Steam sale report bot and you have the tools
and know-how to start pulling data from any other number of resources and
enriching your bot's posts! To keep things simple you can just set up a
cron job to run your bot on a schedule, as well as adding logging and
reporting functions.
