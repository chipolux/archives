I recently took a long road trip up to Seattle and back, I got to see
Mt Rushmore, the Grand Tetons, the Golden Gate bridge, the Mojave desert,
and the Grand Canyon all in one go! Here's pictures from the first half,
from Northwest Arkansas to Eugene, OR!

If you need [part two, it's here!](http://nbwright.net/2013/10/29/seattle-trip-part-two/)

##Day One
Day one was a long trek from Northwest Arkansas up into Sioux Falls, SD.

##Day Two
Day two took me from Sioux Falls, SD all the way to Casper, WY. Along
the way I passed through the Badlands and saw some big ol' faces in a
mountain!

##Day Three
The third day saw me cross the entirety of Wyoming, from Casper to Idaho
Falls, ID. The Grand Teton's were absolutely beautiful.

##Day Four
On the fourth day I trekked across Idaho and on into Walla Walla,
Washington. It was a smooth ride across the final outcroppings of the
Northern Rocky Mountains.

into Seattle!
