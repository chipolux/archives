This is the first of what may be a lot of posts.
I've decided to restructure my old webserver and site to put my project
work first and the minecraft stuff second.

If you're stumbling across this because you used to play on my minecraft
servers, don't worry! They're still just around the corner
[here](http://nbwright.net/butrcraft)!

This post is mostly just a test bed for remembering all the markdown
syntax and how it works inside Mynt.

<pre><code data-lang="python">
print 'This should be a code example.'
words = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'loop.']
for word in words:
    sentence += word + ' '
print sentence.strip()
</code></pre>
