I've made a quick and dirty Catbug soundboard! If you just want the
soundboard [click here](http://nbwright.net/catbug), if you want to read
about my process take the jump.

Yesterday I started pulling down videos from YouTube, everything I could
find with [Sam Lavagnino's](http://bravestwarriors.wikia.com/wiki/Sam_Lavagnino) voice. He's the kid who plays everyones favorite [Catbug](http://bravestwarriors.wikia.com/wiki/Catbug)
in Bravest Warriors!

I ended up with seven videos totalling about 940MB over an hour and a half.

My intent is to pull out all the important bits to create a kind of speech
engine using his voice.

So I pulled out all the audio from each video and started stripping out
just the clips of him.

That got me 70 clips that are 2-15 seconds long!

Around this stage I realized that the clips I had would be _perfect_ for a
soundboard.

Using [this](https://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/2009/08/06/html5-audio-soundboard)
as a guide I threw together a soundboard you can find
[here](http://nbwright.net/catbug)!

I figure later on I'll get around to making a speech synthesizer but for
now this'll do.
