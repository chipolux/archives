Part two of the long journey. I go from Oregon on down through California
and then back East towards home!

If you need [part one, it's here!](http://nbwright.net/2013/10/28/seattle-trip-part-one/)

##Day Seven
From Eugene I started the longest day of the journey. From the center of
Oregon down to San Francisco.

##Day Eight
After spending the night in Santa Cruz I trekked along the beaches of
California, taking Route 1 South and then heading East to Barstow.

##Day Nine
From Barstow I make my way across the Mojave Desert and on to the
Grand Canyon and Flagstaff, AZ.

##Day Ten
I leave Flagstaff and drive all the way across New Mexico without breaking
a sweat. After Amarillo it's only a few short hours on home.

##Day Eleven
I finally make it back to Oklahoma and Arkansas, my home states. Nothing
really to see here, it was all familiar territory.
