Just the source for my site to keep track of post history and template changes.

You can compile the end result HTML and such using mynt like so:

    sudo pip install mynt
    mynt gen /path/to/repo /path/for/output

If you'd like to suggest changes to the layout, correct any typos I might have, or anything else feel free to submit a pull request!
