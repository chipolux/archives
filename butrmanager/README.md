#ButrManager
##Lightweight Minecraft Server Management

###Usage
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Adjust `server/config.json` and `client/config.json` to fit your needs.
* `python butrserver.py` to start server
* `python butrclient.py` to use client

I recommend using [mcrcon](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcrcon/) for
running commands on remote minecraft servers.
